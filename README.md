# JSpecify

**This project is still under active development. Any and all aspects of
the API and specifications are subject to change prior to the 1.0 release.
Using the annotations in a released library is not recommended.**

An artifact of well-specified annotations to power static analysis checks and
JVM language interop.  Developed by consensus of the partner organizations
listed at our main web site, [jspecify.org](http://jspecify.org).

Our current focus is on annotations for nullness analysis.
