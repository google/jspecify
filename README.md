# JSpecify 0.1

(This README is for the 0.1 milestone. For the main project README, see
[our GitHub landing page](https://github.com/jspecify/jspecify).)

To recognize the progress of the past two years, we've long wanted to declare a
milestone. But we've held off, waiting until we had "something a select few end
users could view" or "something that gives a tool author enough information to
implement a full set of semantics."

A frequent question has been: Why not just take what we have so far, remove all
but the bare essentials (e.g., remove `@NullnessUnspecified`), and tag that? So
that's what this milestone is for.

This 0.1 milestone omits some of the work we've already completed, and we have
much more work underway and yet to come. Everything remains **not set in
stone**, and we don't expect tool authors or library owners to adopt 0.1.

Still, this milestone gives us something concrete. Plus, tool authors who want
to compare their existing semantics against our sample inputs get an officially
stamped commit to reference.
