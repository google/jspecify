/**
 * Indicates that the annotated type usage (commonly a variable type or return type) is considered
 * to include {@code null} as a value.
 *
 * <p>Example usages:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Nullable String field;
 *
 * @Nullable String getField() { return field; }
 *
 * void setField(@Nullable String value) { field = value; }
 *
 * List<@Nullable String> getList() { … }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For a guided introduction to JSpecify nullness annotations, please see the <a
 * href="http://jspecify.org/docs/user-guide">User Guide</a>.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> These annotations are under development, and <b>any</b> aspect of their
 * naming, locations, or design is subject to change until the JSpecify 1.0 release. Moreover,
 * supporting analysis tools will be tracking the changes on varying schedules. Releasing a library
 * using these annotations in its API is <b>strongly discouraged</b> at this time.
 *
 * <h2 id="augmented-types">Augmented types</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code javac}‘s type system ignores this annotation: in all the examples above, the type it
 * recognizes is "string (of ambiguous nullness)", as always. {@code javac} always treats a variable
 * of such type <i>leniently</i>: you can freely assign {@code null} to it (as if it's nullable),
 * yet you can freely deference it as well (as if it's non-null). We call this type the <b>base
 * type</b>.
 *
 * <p>It's the function of a JSpecify-compatible <b>nullness analyzer</b> to interpret {@code
 * String} and {@code @Nullable String} (for example) as <i>though</i> they are properly distinct
 * types. (We will use {@code String} as a convenient example type throughout this documentation.)
 * We call a base type together with its nullness indicator (usually, "nullable" or "non-null") an
 * <b>augmented type</b>.
 *
 * <h2 id="notation">Important note on notation</h2>
 *
 * <p>Augmented types are indicated in prose using a <b>shorthand</b>, combining a base type with a
 * symbol representing a nullness indicator. (<a href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>)
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code String!} represents the <b>non-null form</b> of the base type {@code String}: a
 *       reference to an actual string object. This might be expressed in Java code as
 *       {@code @NonNull String}, or, within null-marked code, as just {@code String}.
 *   <li>{@code String?} represents the <b>nullable form</b> of the base type {@code String}: a
 *       "string-or-null". This is usually expressed in Java as {@code @Nullable String}.
 *   <li>{@code String*} represents the <b>unspecified form</b>, as we would find in fully
 *       unannotated code. This is included here to round out the set; a proper explanation of
 *       unspecified nullness is in the <a href="http://jspecify.org/docs/user-guide">User
 *       Guide</a>.
 *   <li>A type variable with no suffix, like {@code T}, has <a
 *       href="NullMarked.html#special-cases">parametric nullness</a>. Any suffix above would
 *       indicate a <i>projection</i> of the type variable (see below).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For a complex example, a nullable array containing non-null arrays, in turn containing strings
 * of unspecified nullness, would be written {@code String*[]![]?}. For a parameterized type, the
 * suffix appears immediately after the class name ({@code Foo!<Bar?>}) rather than after the entire
 * type ({@code Foo<Bar?>!}).
 *
 * <p>A tool might use this shorthand in its error messages, but be aware that it might follow its
 * own similar but different scheme instead.
 *
 * <h2 id="subtypes">Subtypes</h2>
 *
 * <p>The Java Language Specification defines the subtype relation among base types. That definition
 * is extended here to cover augmented types: specifically, the non-null form of any base type is a
 * subtype of its nullable form. This relation extends transitively: for a base type {@code Foo}
 * with supertype {@code SuperFoo}, the augmented type {@code Foo!} is a subtype of {@code Foo?}, of
 * {@code SuperFoo!}, and of {@code SuperFoo?}. [TODO: diagram this.]
 *
 * <p>(How types with unspecified nullness fit into this picture requires <a
 * href="http://jspecify.org/docs/user-guide">more explanation</a>.)
 *
 * <p>In <i>general</i>, for any scenario where the Java Language Specification checks for
 * subtyping, this extended definition applies. For example, array covariance respects it: {@code
 * Foo![]} is a subtype of {@code Foo?[]}. Generics are still invariant, so {@code List!<Foo!>} is
 * <i>not</i> a subtype of {@code List!<Foo?>}, but it is a subtype of {@code List!<? extends
 * Foo?>}.
 *
 * <p>This makes {@code Object?} the new "top type" of the hierarchy: the common supertype of every
 * reference type. One consequence is that {@code List<? extends Object>} no longer means "any
 * list": it now excludes lists with null elements, unlike {@code List<?>}.
 *
 * <h2>Kinds of type usages</h2>
 *
 * <p>The essential meaning of this annotation is always the same: the type in use is considered to
 * include {@code null} as a value. But this may affect your code a little differently based on the
 * kind of type usage involved. Still using the examples at top:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>On a <b>parameter type:</b> The {@code setField} method permissively accepts a
 *       "string-or-null", meaning that it is okay to pass an actual string, or to pass {@code
 *       null}. (This doesn't guarantee that passing {@code null} can't produce an exception at
 *       runtime, but it should be much less likely.)
 *   <li>On a <b>method return type:</b> The {@code getField} method returns a "string-or-null", so
 *       while the caller might get a string back, it should also address the possibility of getting
 *       {@code null} instead. (This doesn't guarantee there is any circumstance in which {@code
 *       null} <i>will</i> actually be returned.)
 *   <li>On a <b>field type:</b> The {@code field} field has the type "string-or-null", so at times
 *       it might hold a string, and at times it might hold {@code null}. (Of course, every field of
 *       a reference type <i>originally</i> holds {@code null}, but as long as the class ensures
 *       that its uninitialized states can't be observed, it's appropriate to overlook that fact.)
 *   <li>On a non-wildcard<b> type argument:</b> A type usage of "nullable string" appears
 *       <i>within</i> the compound type {@code List<@Nullable String>}. No matter how this type is
 *       used (return type, local variable type, etc.), this tells us the same thing: when using
 *       this type, every appearance of {@code E} in {@code List}'s member signatures will be
 *       considered nullable. For a list, this means it may contain null <i>elements</i>. If the
 *       list reference itself might be null as well, we can write {@code @Nullable List<@Nullable
 *       String>}, a "nullable list of nullable strings". Type arguments supplied to a generic
 *       method invocation or class instance creation expression work similarly.
 *   <li>On a<b> type parameter bound:</b> If a type parameter's upper bound is annotated with
 *       {@code @Nullable}, as in {@code class Foo<T extends @Nullable Object>}, that means that
 *       {@code T} may be bound to nullable types, as in {@code Foo<@Nullable String>}.
 *   <li>On a<b> type variable</b> usage: A type parameter, like the {@code E} in {@code interface
 *       List<E>}, defines a type variable of the same name, usable only <i>within</i> the scope of
 *       the declaring API element. In any example using {@code String} above, a type variable like
 *       {@code E} might appear instead. {@code @Nullable} continues to mean "or null" as always,
 *       but notably, this works without regard to whether the type argument is <i>already</i>
 *       nullable. For example, given {@code class Foo<E extends @Nullable Object>}, with a method
 *       {@code @Nullable E eOrNull()}, then whether {@code foo} is of type {@code Foo<String>} or
 *       {@code Foo<@Nullable String>}, the expression {@code foo.eOrNull()} is always nullable.
 *       Using {@code @Nullable E} in this way is called "nullable projection" (<a
 *       href="NonNull.html#projection">non-null projection</a> is likewise supported, but less
 *       commonly useful).
 *   <li>On a <b>nested type</b>: In most examples above, in place of {@code String} we might use a
 *       nested type such as {@code Map.Entry}. The Java syntax for annotating such a type as
 *       nullable looks like {@code Map.@Nullable Entry}.
 *   <li>On a <b>record component</b>: As expected, {@code @Nullable} here applies equally to the
 *       corresponding parameter type of the canonical constructor, and <i>if</i> an accessor method
 *       is generated, to that method's return type as well. An explicit accessor method, if
 *       present, is unaffected: it should be annotated explicitly. Note that checking the
 *       expected-non-null components can be done in a "compact constructor".
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2 id="applicability">Where it is not applicable</h2>
 *
 * <p>This annotation and {@link NonNull} are applicable to any type usage except the following
 * cases, where they have no defined meaning:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>On any<b> intrinsically non-null type usage</b>. Some type usages are incapable of
 *       including {@code null} by the rules of the Java language. Examples include any usage of a
 *       primitive type, the argument to {@code instanceof}, a method return type in an annotation
 *       interface, or the type following {@code throws} or {@code catch}. In such locations, a
 *       nullness annotation could only be contradictory ({@code @Nullable}) or redundant
 *       ({@code @NonNull}).
 *   <li>On the root type of a <b>local variable</b> declaration. The nullness of a local variable
 *       itself is not a fixed declarative property of its <i>type</i>. Rather it should be inferred
 *       from the nullness of each expression assigned to the variable, possibly changing over time.
 *       (<a href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>). Subcomponents of the type (type arguments,
 *       array component types) are annotatable as usual.
 *   <li>On the root type in a <b>cast expression</b>. To inform an analyzer that an expression it
 *       sees as nullable is truly non-null, use an assertion or a method like {@link
 *       java.util.Objects#requireNonNull}. (<a href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>)
 *       Subcomponents of the type (type arguments, array component types) are annotatable as usual.
 *   <li>On a <b>class declaration</b>. Java permits any type-use annotation to be used as a class
 *       annotation ({@code @Annotation class Foo}). However, this is not a type usage, and JSpecify
 *       nullness annotations have no meaning in such a location. (<a
 *       href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>)
 *   <li>On a <b>type parameter or wildcard</b>: Java also permits any type-use annotation to be
 *       placed before a type parameter declaration ({@code class Foo<@Annotation T>}) or a wildcard
 *       type argument ({@code Foo<@Annotation ? extends Bar>}). However, these are not type usages,
 *       and JSpecify nullness annotations have no meaning in such locations. (<a
 *       href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>) The <i>bounds</i> of a type parameter or wildcard
 *       are type usages and are annotatable as usual.
 *   <li>On <i>any</i> part of a <b>receiver parameter</b> type (<a
 *       href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se18/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4">JLS 8.4</a>).
 * </ul>
 *
 * Whether the code is {@link NullMarked} also has no consequence in these locations.
 *
 * <h2>Unannotated type usages</h2>
 *
 * <p>For a type usage where nullness annotations are <a href="#applicability">applicable</a> but
 * not present, its nullness depends on whether it appears within {@linkplain NullMarked
 * null-marked} code; see that class for details.
