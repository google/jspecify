/**
 * Indicates that the annotated element and the code transitively {@linkplain
 * javax.lang.model.element.Element#getEnclosedElements() enclosed} within it are <b>null-marked
 * code</b>: there, type usages are generally considered to exclude {@code null} as a value unless
 * specified otherwise. Using this annotation avoids the need to write {@link NonNull @NonNull} many
 * times throughout your code.
 *
 * <p>For a guided introduction to JSpecify nullness annotations, please see the <a
 * href="http://jspecify.org/docs/user-guide">User Guide</a>.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> These annotations are under development, and <b>any</b> aspect of their
 * naming, locations, or design is subject to change until the JSpecify 1.0 release. Moreover,
 * supporting analysis tools will be tracking the changes on varying schedules. Releasing a library
 * using these annotations in its API is <b>strongly discouraged</b> at this time.
 *
 * <h2>Effects of being null-marked</h2>
 *
 * <p>Within null-marked code, as a <i>general</i> rule, a type usage is considered non-null (to
 * exclude {@code null} as a value) unless explicitly annotated as {@link Nullable}. However, there
 * are several special cases to address.
 *
 * <h3 id="special-cases">Special cases</h3>
 *
 * <p>Within null-marked code:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Being null-marked has no consequence for any type usage where {@code @Nullable} and
 *       {@code @NonNull} are <a href="Nullable.html#applicability"><b>not applicable</b></a>, such
 *       as the root type of a local variable declaration.
 *   <li>An <b>unbounded wildcard</b> (the {@code ?} in a type like {@code List<?>}, not followed by
 *       {@code extends} or {@code super}) represents <i>any</i> type within the type parameter's
 *       bounds with no further restriction. A <b>lower-bounded wildcard</b> ({@code List<? super
 *       String>}) similarly has no <i>upper</i> bound of its own. Therefore, since <i>nullable</i>
 *       {@code Object} is the new "<a href="Nullable.html#subtypes">top type</a>", either list
 *       might have null elements, even though the word {@code @Nullable} is nowhere in sight. On
 *       the other hand, in {@code List<? extends Object>} a bound <i>is</i> provided, and as usual,
 *       being unannotated it is considered non-null. This means that while {@code List<?>} and
 *       {@code List<? extends Object>} have always been identical as base types, they are no longer
 *       identical as <a href="Nullable.html#augmented-types">augmented types</a>. (<a
 *       href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>)
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>Conversely, a <b>type parameter</b> is always bounded: when none is given explicitly,
 *             {@code Object} is filled in by the compiler. The example {@code class MyList<E>} is
 *             interpreted identically to {@code class MyList<E extends Object>}: in both cases the
 *             type argument in {@code MyList<@Nullable Foo>} is out-of-bounds, so the list elements
 *             are always non-null. (<a href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>)
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>A usage of a <b>nullable-bounded type variable</b> (such as the {@code E} in {@code class
 *       Foo<E extends @Nullable Bar>}) is not considered nullable, non-null, or even of
 *       "unspecified" nullness. Rather it has <b>parametric nullness</b>. In order to support both
 *       nullable and non-null type arguments safely, the {@code E} type itself must be handled
 *       <i>strictly</i>: as if nullable when "read from", but as if non-null when "written to".
 *       (Contrast with {@code class Foo<E extends Bar>}, where usages of {@code E} are simply
 *       non-null, just like usages of {@code String}.)
 *   <li>By using {@link NullUnmarked}, an element within null-marked code can be excluded and made
 *       null-unmarked, exactly as if there were no enclosing {@code @NullMarked} element at all.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Warning about package annotations</h2>
 *
 * <p>Use caution when applying this annotation to a package (via {@code package-info}) that does
 * not belong to a module. It is possible for different versions of {@code package-info} to be
 * visible in different analysis scenarios, which could cause the same single class to be
 * interpreted inconsistently. As one example, a {@code package-info} file from a "test" source root
 * might hide the one from the "main" source root.
