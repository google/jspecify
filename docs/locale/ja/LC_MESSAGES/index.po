msgid ""
"Java static analysis tools, such as Error Prone and those built into "
"IDEs, have been very successful at enabling automated refactorings and "
"bug prevention. Many of their most beneficial analyses require certain "
"Java annotations (such as ``@Nullable`` or ``@Immutable``) to be present "
"in the source or class file. Yet for the 15 years since Java annotations "
"were introduced (five years for type-use annotations), users have never "
"had a clear answer for which incarnation of these annotation classes they"
" can safely adopt. Many such artifacts have been created, but there has "
"never been a serious and successful effort to provide a single well-"
"specified standard with industry consensus. The lack of this artifact has"
" constrained the prevalence and overall value of static analysis "
"technology throughout the industry. It has encouraged today's tools to "
"accept a wide variety of annotations, treating them equivalently, which "
"renders the annotation specifications meaningless (an API owner cannot "
"know whether applying a particular annotation is correct without knowing "
"which tool its users will be using to interpret them). Finally, it "
"complicates interoperation between Java and other JVM languages, which "
"sometimes expect additional API metadata (such as nullability) that the "
"Java language can't express. This missing artifact, with full "
"specifications, is what we are working to create. [1]_"
