## What is this?

[A group of organizations](/about) are working together to define a common set
of annotation types for use in JVM languages, to improve static analysis and
language interoperation. Our initial focus is on nullness analysis.

This includes providing both an artifact of annotation types your code can
depend on, and *precise* specifications of their semantics.

* **Why standardize the annotations?** Because you deserve better than this
  tragic [stackoverflow answer] depicts.
* **Why standardize the semantics?** Because you deserve a single source of
  truth for how your code should be annotated, instead of having to decide
  which tool to please at the expense of the others.
* **Why do both together?** Because you deserve to find that information
  easily, right in the javadoc of the annotation classes themselves.

JSpecify is developed by consensus of major stakeholders in Java static
analysis. Our eventual 1.0 release will be the first tool-neutral,
library-neutral artifact for these annotations. (Note: `javax.annotation` was an
attempt at this that never reached consensus and was never actually released.)

Learn more about the JSpecify group and its goals in the JSpecify [FAQ].

## How do I learn about your nullness support?

Here are some links. As you read them, you'll probably have a number of "why?"
questions, which you can look for in the [Nullness Design FAQ]. If you like,
[send us mail](mailto:jspecify-discuss@googlegroups.com).

### Begin with one of

* The current [User Guide] draft
* The [Javadoc], which is not a *tutorial* walkthrough, but is thorough,
  specific, and current.

### Then if you're *really* interested

* The [specification], written to be understood by owners of compilers and
  static analysis tools. Note that it currently matches JSpecify 0.2, not 0.3.
* Our [wiki] has about 20 informal, non-normative articles on various topics
* Open [issues]
* Or try it out...

### Trying it out?

* You might wish to be an early adopter of **version 0.3** in your projects;
  see the [adoption](https://github.com/jspecify/jspecify/wiki/adoption) wiki
  page for advice.
* Please experiment with our 
  **[reference implementation](https://github.com/jspecify/jspecify-reference-checker)**.
  This lets you validate your usages of the annotations against our defined
  semantics, which is when you will really get to find out how helpful or 
  annoying our current design choices are for you (which you should let us
  know!). However, this tool is still a work in progress, and is not at *full*
  conformance with our own specification quite yet.
* **Version 1.0** will commit **permanently** to the annotation APIs, and they
  will be safe to depend on. From that point, no compile-breaking changes will
  ever happen, and future specification adjustments will affect only corner cases.
  We don't have a date for this release, but it is primarily blocked on community
  input!

## How can I get involved?

Great question.

It's not too late for your input to matter. We've laid in a lot of groundwork,
but nothing is "baked in" yet (except the package name, as of 0.3).

* Join our new [Google Group]. Introduce yourself! Ask questions, complain, or
  just tell us what you're hoping to see. If your organization should be a
  member of our group, tell us about yourselves and self-nominate.
* Do you use any libraries or tools that you think should use/support JSpecify
  annotations? Please tell them about us!
* Give some thought to what factors would make your own projects more or less
  likely to adopt JSpecify, and let us know.
* [File an issue] to request a feature or if something is wrong.
* Star and Watch our [github] repo.
