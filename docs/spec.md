# JSpecify nullness spec draft

This document is our draft specification for the semantics of a set of nullness
annotations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Temporary advice to readers (non-normative)

For someone new to our nullness annotations, this document does not make a good
introduction. This document is targeted more at tool authors or advanced users.
New users will prefer to start with our [User Guide]. We are working on further
user documentation, including Javadoc.

### The word "nullable"

In this doc, I aim not to refer to whether a type "is nullable." Instead, I draw
some distinctions, creating roughly 3 kinds of "Is it nullable?" questions we
can ask for any given type usage. Each kind is derived (at least in part) from
the previous:

1.  Does `@Nullable` appear directly on that type usage?
2.  What is the [nullness operator] of that type usage?
3.  For that type usage...
    -   Is it "reasonable" to assume that is not `null`?
    -   Is it "reasonable" to put a `null` into it?
    -   neither (what we sometimes call "parametric nullness")
    -   both (as can happen with [nullness operator] `UNSPECIFIED` under lenient
        tools)

### The scope of this spec

This spec does not address _when_ tools must apply a given check. For example,
it does not state when tools must apply the [subtyping] check.

We anticipate that tools will typically apply them in the same cases that they
apply standard Java checks. For example, if code contains the parameterized type
`List<@Nullable Foo>`, we anticipate that tools will check that `@Nullable Foo`
is a subtype of the bound of the type parameter of `List`.

However, this is up to tool authors, who may have reasons to take a different
approach. For example:

-   Java
    [requires checks in some cases in which they aren't necessary for soundness][#49],
    and it [doesn't require checks in some cases in which checks _are_ necessary
    for soundness][#65].

-   JSpecify annotations can be used even by tools that are not "nullness
    checkers" at all. For example, a tool that lists the members of an API could
    show the nullness of each type in the API, without any checking that those
    types are "correct."

-   Even when a tool is a "nullness checker," it might be written for another
    language, like Kotlin, with its own rules for when to perform type checks.
    Or the tool might target a future version of Java whose language features
    would not be covered by this version of this spec.

Note also that this spec covers only nullness information _from JSpecify
annotations_. Tools may have additional sources of information. For example, a
tool may recognize additional annotations. Or a tool may define a rule to treat
all unannotated type usages the same, rather than implementing different
behavior for those that this spec assigns "unspecified nullness."

### That's all!

On to the spec.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Normative and non-normative sections

This document contains some non-normative comments to emphasize points or to
anticipate likely questions. Those comments are set off as block quotes.

> This is an example of a non-normative comment.

This document also links to other documents. Those documents are non-normative,
except for when we link to the Java Language Specification to defer to its
rules.

## References to concepts defined by this spec

When a rule in this spec refers to any concept that is defined in this spec (for
example, [substitution] or [containment]), apply this spec's definition (as
opposed to other definitions, such as the ones in the JLS).

Additionally, when a rule in this spec refers to a JLS rule that in turn refers
to a concept that is defined in this spec, likewise apply this spec's
definition.

In particular, when a JLS rule refers to types, apply this spec's definition of
[augmented types] \(as oppposed to [base types]).

## Base type

A _base type_ is a type as defined in [JLS 4].

> JLS 4 does not consider type-use annotations to be part of types, so neither
> does our concept of "base type."

## Type components

A _type component_ of a given type is a type that transitively forms some part
of that type. Specifically, a type component is one of the following:

-   a non-wildcard type argument
-   a wildcard bound
-   an array component type
-   an enclosing type
-   an element of an intersection type
-   the entire type

## Nullness operator

A nullness operator is one of 4 values:

-   `UNION_NULL`
-   `NO_CHANGE`
-   `UNSPECIFIED`
-   `MINUS_NULL`

> The distinction among these 4 values is similar to the distinction among the
> Kotlin types `Foo?`, `Foo`, `Foo!`, and `Foo!!`, respectively.

## Augmented type

An augmented type consists of a [base type] and a [nullness operator]
corresponding to _each_ of its [type components].

For our purposes, base types (and thus augmented types) include not just class
and interface types, array types, and type variables but also
[intersection types] and the null type.

> This spec aims to define rules for augmented types compatible with those that
> the JLS defines for base types.
>
> Accordingly, in almost all cases, this spec agrees with the JLS's rules when
> specifying what _base_ types appear in a piece of code. It makes an exception
> for ["Bound of an unbounded wildcard,"](#unbounded-wildcard) for which it
> specifies a bound of `Object` that the JLS does not specify.

When this spec uses capital letters, they refer to augmented types (unless
otherwise noted). This is in contrast to the JLS, which typically uses them to
refer to base types.

When this spec refers to "the nullness operator of" a type `T`, it refers
specifically to the nullness operator of the type component that is the entire
type `T`, without reference to the nullness operator of any other type
components of `T`.

> For example, "the nullness operator of `List<Object>`" refers to whether the
> list itself may be `null`, not whether its elements may be.

## Details common to all annotations

-   The package name is `org.jspecify.nullness`. \[[#1]\]
-   The Java module name is `org.jspecify`. \[[#181]\]
-   The Maven artifact is `org.jspecify:jspecify`. \[[#181]\]

All annotations have runtime retention. \[[#28]\] None of the annotations are
marked [repeatable].

## The type-use annotation

We provide a parameterless type-use annotation called `@Nullable`.

### Recognized locations for type-use annotations

A location is a _recognized_ location for our type-use annotation in the
circumstances detailed below. A type at a recognized location has the semantics
described in this spec. The spec does not assign semantics to types in other
locations, nor to any annotations on such types.

> For now, we've chosen to restrict ourselves to API locations for which tools
> mostly agree on what it means for a type in that location to be `@Nullable`.

The following locations are recognized except when overruled by one of the
exceptions in the subsequent sections: \[[#17]\]

-   return type of a method

-   formal parameter type of a method or constructor, as defined in [JLS 8.4.1]

    > This excludes the receiver parameter.

-   field type

-   type parameter upper bound \[[#60]\]

-   non-wildcard type argument

-   wildcard bound

-   array component type

-   type used in a variadic parameter declaration

However, any location above is unrecognized if it matches either of the
following cases: \[[#17]\]

> We refer to these cases (and some other cases below) as "intrinsically
> non-nullable."

-   a type usage of a primitive type

-   the outer type that qualifies an inner type

    > For example, the annotation in `@Nullable Foo.Bar` is in an unrecognized
    > location: Java syntax attaches it to the outer type `Foo`.

    > Every outer type is intrinsically non-nullable because every instance of
    > an inner class has an associated instance of the outer class.

Additionally, any location above is unrecognized if it makes up _any
[type component]_ of a type in the following locations: \[[#17]\]

> These locations all fit under the umbrella of "implementation code."
> Implementation code may use types that contain type arguments, wildcard
> bounds, and array component types, which would be recognized locations if not
> for the exceptions defined by this section.

-   a local variable type
-   an exception parameter
-   the type in a cast expression
-   an array or object creation expression
-   an explicit type argument supplied to a generic method or constructor
    (including via a member reference) or to an instance creation expression for
    a generic class

> In practice, we anticipate that tools will treat types (and their annotations)
> in _most_ of the above locations much like they treat types in other
> locations. Still, this spec does not concern itself with implementation code:
> We believe that the most important domain for us to focus on is that of APIs.

All locations that are not explicitly listed as recognized are unrecognized.

> Other notable unrecognized annotations include: \[[#17]\]
>
> Some additional intrinsically non-nullable locations:
>
> -   supertype in a class declaration
> -   thrown exception type
> -   enum constant declaration
> -   receiver parameter type
>
> Some other locations that individual tools are more likely to assign semantics
> to:
>
> -   a class declaration \[[#7]\]: For example, the annotation in `public
>     @Nullable class Foo {}` is in an unrecognized location.
> -   a type-parameter declaration or a wildcard _itself_ \[[#19], [#31]\]
> -   any [type component] of a receiver parameter type \[[#157]\]
>
> But note that types "inside" some of these locations can still be recognized,
> such as a _type argument_ of a supertype.

> When analyzing source code, tools are encouraged to offer an option to issue
> an error for an annotation in an unrecognized location (unless they define
> semantics for that location). Tools are especially encouraged to issue an
> error for an annotation in a location that is intrinsically non-nullable. When
> reading _bytecode_, however, tools may be best off ignoring an annotation in
> an unrecognized location (again, unless they define semantics for that
> location).

## The declaration annotation

We provide a single parameterless declaration annotation called `@NullMarked`.
\[[#5], [#87]\]

### Recognized locations for declaration annotations

Our declaration annotation is specified to be _recognized_ when applied to the
locations listed below:

-   A _named_ class.
-   A package. \[[#34]\]
-   A module. \[[#34]\]

> _Not_ a method \[[#43]\], constructor \[[#43]\], or field \[[#50]\].

(concept-references)=

## Null-marked scope

To determine whether a type usage appears in a null-marked scope:

Look for an `@org.jspecify.nullness.NullMarked` annotation on any of the
enclosing scopes surrounding the type usage.

Class members are enclosed by classes, which may be enclosed by other class
members or classes. and top-level classes are enclosed by packages, which may be
enclosed by modules.

> Packages are *not* enclosed by "parent" packages.

> This definition of "enclosing" likely matches
> [the definition in the Java compiler API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.compiler/javax/lang/model/element/Element.html#getEnclosingElement\(\)).

If one of those scopes is directly annotated with
`@org.jspecify.nullness.NullMarked`, then the type usage is in a null-marked
scope. Otherwise, it is not.

(augmented-type-of-usage)=

## Augmented type of a type usage appearing in code

For most type usages in source code or bytecode on which JSpecify nullness
annotations are [recognized], this section defines how to determine their
[augmented types]. Note, however, that rules for specific cases below take
precedence over the general rule here.

Because the JLS already has rules for determining the [base type] for a type
usage, this section covers only how to determine its [nullness operator].

To determine the nullness operator, apply the following rules in order. Once one
condition is met, skip the remaining conditions.

-   If the type usage is annotated with `@org.jspecify.nullness.Nullable`, its
    nullness operator is `UNION_NULL`.
-   If the type usage appears in a [null-marked scope], its nullness operator is
    `NO_CHANGE`.
-   Its nullness operator is `UNSPECIFIED`.

> The choice of nullness operator is *not* affected by any nullness operator
> that appears in a corresponding location in a supertype. For example, if one
> type declares a method whose return type is annotated `@Nullable`, and if
> another type overrides that method but does not declare the return type as
> `@Nullable`, then the override's return type will *not* have nullness operator
> `UNION_NULL`.

> The rules here never produce the fourth nullness operator, `MINUS_NULL`. (It
> will appear later in [substitution]. Additionally, we anticipate that tools
> will produce `MINUS_NULL` based on the results of null checks in
> implementation code.) However, if tool authors prefer, they can safely produce
> `MINUS_NULL` in any case in which it is equivalent to `NO_CHANGE`. For
> example, there is no difference between a `String` with `NO_CHANGE` and a
> `String` with `MINUS_NULL`.

(intersection-types)=

## Augmented type of an intersection type

> Technically speaking, the JLS does not define syntax for an intersection type.
> Instead, it defines a syntax for type parameters and casts that supports
> multiple types. Then the intersection type is derived from those. Intersection
> types can also arise from operations like [capture conversion]. See [JLS 4.9].
>
> One result of this is that it's never possible for a programmer to write an
> annotation "on an intersection type."

This spec assigns a [nullness operator] to each individual element of an
intersection type, following our normal rules for type usages. It also assigns a
nullness operator to the intersection type as a whole. The nullness operator of
the type as a whole is always `NO_CHANGE`.

> This lets us provide, for every [base type], a rule for computing its
> [augmented type]. But we require `NO_CHANGE` so as to avoid questions like
> whether "a `UNION_NULL` intersection type whose members are `UNION_NULL` `Foo`
> and `UNION_NULL` `Bar`" is a subtype of "a `NO_CHANGE` intersection type with
> those same members." Plus, it would be difficult for tools to output the
> nullness operator of an intersection type in a human-readable way.

> To avoid ever creating an intersection type with a nullness operator other
> than `NO_CHANGE`, we define special handling for intersection types under
> ["Applying a nullness operator to an augmented type."][applying operator]

(unbounded-wildcard)=

## Bound of an "unbounded" wildcard

In source, an unbounded wildcard is written as `<?>`. This section does **not**
apply to `<? extends Object>`, even though that is often equivalent to `<?>`.

> See [JLS 4.5.1].

In bytecode, such a wildcard is represented as a wildcard type with an empty
list of upper bounds and an empty list of lower bounds. This section does
**not** apply to a wildcard with any bounds in either list, even a sole upper
bound of `Object`.

> For a wildcard with an explicit bound of `Object` (that is, `<? extends
> Object>`, perhaps with an annotation on `Object`), instead apply
> [the normal rules](#augmented-type-of-usage) for the explicit bound type.

If an unbounded wildcard appears in a [null-marked scope], then it has a single
upper bound whose [base type] is `Object` and whose [nullness operator] is
`UNION_NULL`.

If an unbounded wildcard appears outside a null-marked scope, then it has a
single upper bound whose base type is `Object` and whose nullness operator is
`UNSPECIFIED`.

> In both cases, we specify a bound that does not exist in the source or
> bytecode, deviating from the JLS. Because the base type of the bound is
> `Object`, this should produce no user-visible differences except to tools that
> implement JSpecify nullness analysis.

Whenever a JLS rule refers specifically to `<?>`, disregard it, and instead
apply the rules for `<? extends T>`, where `T` has a base type of `Object` and
the nullness operator defined by this section.

(object-bounded-type-parameter)=

## Bound of an `Object`-bounded type parameter

In source, an `Object`-bounded type parameter can be writen in either of 2 ways:

-   `<T>`
-   `<T extends Object>` with no JSpecify nullness type annotations on the bound

> See [JLS 4.4].

In bytecode, `<T>` and `<T extends Object>` are both represented as a type
parameter with a single upper bound, `Object`, and no JSpecify nullness type
annotations on the bound.

If an `Object`-bounded type parameter appears in a [null-marked scope], then its
bound has a [base type] of `Object` and a [nullness operator] of `NO_CHANGE`.

> Note that this gives `<T>` a different bound than `<?>` (though only in a
> null-marked scope).

If an `Object`-bounded type parameter appears outside a null-marked scope, then
its bound has a base type of `Object` and a nullness operator of `UNSPECIFIED`.

> All these rules match the behavior of
> [our normal rules](#augmented-type-of-usage) for determining the
> [augmented type] of the bound `Object`. The only "special" part is that we
> consider the source code `<T>` to have a bound of `Object`, just as it does
> when compiled to bytecode.

(null-types)=

## Augmented null types

The JLS refers to "the null type." In this spec, we assign a [nullness operator]
to all types, including the null type. This produces multiple null types:

-   the null [base type] with nullness operator `NO_CHANGE`: the
    "bottom"/"nothing" type used in [capture conversion]

    > No value, including `null` itself, has this type.

-   the null base type with nullness operator `MINUS_NULL`

    > This is equivalent to the previous type. Tools may use the 2
    > interchangeably.

-   the null base type with nullness operator `UNION_NULL`: the type of the null
    reference

-   the null base type with nullness operator `UNSPECIFIED`

    > This may be relevant only in implementation code.

(multiple-worlds)=

## Multiple "worlds"

Some of the rules in this spec come in 2 versions: One version requires a
property to hold "in all worlds," and the other requires it to hold only "in
some world."

Tool authors may wish to implement either or both versions of the rules.

> Our goal is to allow tools and their users to choose their desired level of
> strictness in the presence of `UNSPECIFIED`. The basic idea is that, every
> time a tool encounters a type component with the nullness operator
> `UNSPECIFIED`, it forks off 2 "worlds": 1 in which the operator is
> `UNION_NULL` and 1 in which it is `NO_CHANGE`.
>
> Since we lack a nullness specification for the type, we assume that either of
> the resulting worlds may be the "correct" specification. The all-worlds
> version of a rule, by requiring types to be compatible in all possible worlds,
> holds that types are incompatible unless it has enough information to prove
> they are compatible. The some-world version, by requiring types to be
> compatible only in _some_ world, holds that types are compatible unless it has
> enough information to prove they are incompatible. (By behaving
> "optimistically," the some-world checking behaves much like Kotlin's checking
> of "platform types.")
>
> Thus, strict tools may want to implement the all-worlds version of rules, and
> lenient tools may wish to implement the some-world version. Or a tool might
> implement both and let users select which rules to apply.
>
> Yet another possibility is for a tool to implement both versions and to use
> that to distinguish between "errors" and "warnings." Such a tool might run
> each check first in the all-worlds version and then, if the check fails, run
> it again in the some-world version. If the check fails in both cases, the tool
> would produce an error. If it passes only because of the some-world version,
> the tool would produce a warning.

The main body of each section of the spec describes the all-worlds rule. If the
some-world rule differs, the differences are explained at the end.

> A small warning: To implement the full some-world rules, a tool must also
> implement at least part of the all-worlds rules. Those rules are required as
> part of [substitution].

(propagating-multiple-worlds)=

### Propagating how many worlds a check must hold in

When one rule in this spec refers to another, it refers to the same version of
the rule. For example, when the rules for [containment] refer to the rules for
[subtyping], the some-world containment check applies the some-world subtyping
check, and the all-worlds containment check applies the all-worlds subtyping
check.

This meta-rule applies except when a rule refers explicitly to a particular
version of another rule.

## Same type

`S` and `T` are the same type if `S` is a [subtype] of `T` and `T` is a subtype
of `S`.

The same-type check is _not_ defined to be reflexive or transitive.

> For more discussion of reflexive and transitive checks, see the comments under
> [nullness subtyping].

## Subtyping

`A` is a subtype of `F` if both of the following conditions are met:

-   `A` is a subtype of `F` according to the
    [nullness-delegating subtyping rules for Java].
-   `A` is a [nullness subtype] of `F`.

(nullness-delegating-subtyping)=

## Nullness-delegating subtyping rules for Java

The Java subtyping rules are defined in [JLS 4.10]. We add to them as follows:

-   [As always](#concept-references), interpret the Java rules as operating on
    [augmented types], not [base types]. However, when applying the Java
    direct-supertype rules themselves, _ignore_ the [nullness operator] of the
    input types and output types. The augmented types matter only when the Java
    rules refer to _other_ rules that are defined in this spec. _Those_ rules
    respect the nullness operator of some type components --- but never the
    nullness operator of the type component that represents the whole input or
    output type.

    > To "ignore" the output's nullness operator, we recommend outputting a
    > value of `NO_CHANGE`, since that is valid for all types, including
    > [intersection types].

-   When the Java array rules require one type to be a _direct_ supertype of
    another, consider the direct supertypes of `T` to be _every_ type that `T`
    is a [subtype] of (as always, applying the definition of subtyping in this
    spec).

## Nullness subtyping

> The primary complication in subtyping comes from type-variable usages. Our
> rules for them must account for every combination of type arguments with which
> a given generic type can be parameterized.

`A` is a nullness subtype of `F` if any of the following conditions are met:

-   `F` is [null-inclusive under every parameterization].
-   `A` is [null-exclusive under every parameterization].
-   `A` has a [nullness-subtype-establishing path] to any type whose base type
    is the same as the base type of `F`, and `F` does _not_ have
    [nullness operator] `MINUS_NULL`.

    > The third case is necessary only for type-variable usages.

Nullness subtyping (and thus subtyping itself) is _not_ defined to be reflexive
or transitive.

(Contrast this with our [nullness-delegating subtyping] rules and [containment]
rules: Each of those is defined as a transitive closure. However, technically
speaking,
[there are cases in which those should not be transitive, either](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jspecify-dev/yPnkx_GSb0Q/hLgS_431AQAJ).
Fortunately, this "mostly transitive" behavior is exactly the behavior that
implementations are likely to produce naturally. Maybe someday we will find a
way to specify this fully correctly.)

> Subtyping does end up being transitive when the check is required to hold in
> [all worlds]. And it does end up being reflexive when the check is required to
> hold only in [some world]. We don't state those properties as rules for 2
> reasons: First, they arise naturally from the definitions. Second, we don't

## Null-inclusive under every parameterization

A type is null-inclusive under every parameterization if it meets either of the
following conditions:

-   Its [nullness operator] is `UNION_NULL`.
-   It is an [intersection type] whose elements all are null-inclusive under
    every parameterization.

**Some-world version:** The rule is the same except that the requirement for
"`UNION_NULL`" is loosened to "`UNION_NULL` or `UNSPECIFIED`."

## Null-exclusive under every parameterization

A type is null-exclusive under every parameterization if it has a
[nullness-subtype-establishing path] to either of the following:

-   any type whose [nullness operator] is `MINUS_NULL`
-   any augmented class or array type

    > This rule refers specifically to a "class or array type," as distinct from
    > other types like type variables and [intersection types].

> When code dereferences an expression, we anticipate that tools will check
> whether the expression is null-exclusive under every parameterization.

## Nullness-subtype-establishing path

`A` has a nullness-subtype-establishing path to `F` if both of the following
hold:

-   `A` has [nullness operator] `NO_CHANGE` or `MINUS_NULL`.
-   There is a path from `A` to `F` through
    [nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges].

    > The path may be empty. That is, `A` has a nullness-subtype-establishing
    > path to itself --- as long as it has one of the required nullness
    > operators.

**Some-world version:** The rules are the same except that the requirement for
"`NO_CHANGE` or `MINUS_NULL`" is loosened to "`NO_CHANGE`, `MINUS_NULL`, or
`UNSPECIFIED`."

## Nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges

`T` has nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges to the union of the
nodes computed by the following 2 rules:

Upper-bound rule:

-   if `T` is an augmented [intersection type]: all the intersection type's
    elements whose [nullness operator] is `NO_CHANGE` or `MINUS_NULL`
-   if `T` is an augmented type variable: all the corresponding type parameter's
    upper bounds whose nullness operator is `NO_CHANGE` or `MINUS_NULL`
-   otherwise: no nodes

Lower-bound rule:

-   for every type parameter `P` that has a lower bound whose [base type] is the
    same as `T`'s base type and whose nullness operator is `NO_CHANGE`: the type
    variable `P`

    TODO(cpovirk): What if the lower bound has some other nullness operator? I'm
    pretty sure that we want to allow `UNSPECIFIED` in the some-world version
    (as we did before my recent edits), and we may want to allow more.

-   otherwise: no nodes

**Some-world version:** The rules are the same except that the requirements for
"`NO_CHANGE` or `MINUS_NULL`" are loosened to "`NO_CHANGE`, `MINUS_NULL`, or
`UNSPECIFIED`."

## Containment

The Java rules are defined in [JLS 4.5.1]. We add to them as follows:

-   Disregard the 2 rules that refer to a bare `?`. Instead, treat `?` like `?
    extends Object`, where the [nullness operator] of the `Object` bound is
    specified by ["Bound of an unbounded wildcard."](#unbounded-wildcard)

    > This is just a part of our universal rule to treat a bare `?` like `?
    > extends Object`.

-   The rule written specifically for `? extends Object` applies only if the
    nullness operator of the `Object` bound is `UNION_NULL`.

-   When the JLS refers to the same type `T` on both sides of a rule, the rule
    applies if and only if this spec defines the 2 types to be the [same type].

**Some-world version:** The rules are the same except that the requirement for
"`UNION_NULL`" is loosened to "`UNION_NULL` or `UNSPECIFIED`."

## Substitution

> Substitution on Java base types barely requires an explanation: See [JLS 1.3].
> Substitution on [augmented types], however, is trickier: If `Map.get` returns
> "`V` with [nullness operator] `UNION_NULL`," and if a user has a map whose
> value type is "`String` with nullness operator `UNSPECIFIED`," then what does
> its `get` method return? Naive substitution would produce "`String` with
> nullness operator `UNSPECIFIED` with nullness operator `UNION_NULL`." To
> reduce that to a proper augmented type with a single nullness operator, we
> define this process.

To substitute each type argument `Aᵢ` for each corresponding type parameter
`Pᵢ`:

For every type-variable usage `V` whose [base type] is `Pᵢ`, replace `V` with
the result of the following operation:

-   If `V` is [null-exclusive under every parameterization] in [all worlds],
    then replace it with the result of [applying][applying operator]
    `MINUS_NULL` to `Aᵢ`.

    > This is the one instance in which a rule specifically refers to the
    > [all-worlds] version of another rule. Normally,
    > [a rule "propagates" its version to other rules](#propagating-multiple-worlds).
    > But in this instance, the null-exclusivity rule (and all rules that it in

    `V` to `Aᵢ`.

## Applying a nullness operator to an augmented type

The process of applying a [nullness operator] requires 2 inputs:

-   the nullness operator to apply
-   the [augmented type] \(which, again, includes a [nullness operator] for that
    type) to apply it to

The result of the process is an augmented type.

The process is as follows:

First, based on the pair of nullness operators (the one to apply and the one
from the augmented type), compute a "desired nullness operator." Do so by
applying the following rules in order. Once one condition is met, skip the
remaining conditions.

-   If the nullness operator to apply is `MINUS_NULL`, the desired nullness
    operator is `MINUS_NULL`.
-   If either nullness operator is `UNION_NULL`, the desired nullness operator
    is `UNION_NULL`.
-   If either nullness operator is `UNSPECIFIED`, the desired nullness operator
    is `UNSPECIFIED`.
-   The desired nullness operator is `NO_CHANGE`.

Then, if the input augmented type is _not_ an [intersection type], the output is
the same as the input but with its nullness operator replaced with the desired
nullness operator.

Otherwise, the output is an intersection type. For every element `Tᵢ` of the
input type, the output type has an element that is the result of applying the
desired nullness operator to `Tᵢ`.

> In this case, the desired nullness operator is always equal to the nullness
> operator to apply that was an input to this process. That's because the
> nullness operator of the intersection type itself is defined to always be
> `NO_CHANGE`.

## Capture conversion

The Java rules are defined in [JLS 5.1.10]. We add to them as follows:

-   The parameterized type that is the output of the conversion has the same
    [nullness operator] as the parameterized type that is the input type.

-   Disregard the JLS rule about `<?>`. Instead, treat `?` like `? extends
    Object`, where the [nullness operator] of the `Object` bound is specified by
    ["Bound of an unbounded wildcard."](#unbounded-wildcard)

    > This is just a part of our universal rule to treat a bare `?` like `?
    > extends Object`.

-   When a rule generates a lower bound that is the null type, we specify that
    its nullness operator is `NO_CHANGE`. (See
    ["Augmented null types."](#null-types))
